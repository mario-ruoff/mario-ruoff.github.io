# Hi, I'm Mario Ruoff

I'm a software engineer passionate about autonomous driving and deep learning. I recently completed my master's thesis at Mercedes-Benz, focusing on vehicle motion prediction for autonomous driving, and I'm now looking for exciting opportunities in the field.

I reveived my master's degree in Autonomous Systems from the University of Stuttgart and a bachelor's in Computer Science from DHBW Stuttgart. In my free time, I enjoy building ad-free, open source apps that simplify everyday life.
