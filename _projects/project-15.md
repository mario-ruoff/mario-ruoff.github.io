## Description
Minimal Launcher is a free, open-source launcher app without any ads or in-app purchases. It is a fork of the original app Olauncher by tanujnotes: [Olauncher | Minimal AF Launcher](https://github.com/tanujnotes/Olauncher)

## Repository
[mario-ruoff/minimal-launcher](https://github.com/mario-ruoff/minimal-launcher){: .btn .btn--inverse}

## Install
Download the APK from the [latest release](https://github.com/mario-ruoff/minimal-launcher/releases/).
> The original OLauncher version can be installed from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/app.olauncher) or [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.olauncher).

To maintain the simplicity of the launcher, a few niche features are available but hidden.

Please check out the [About](https://tanujnotes.substack.com/p/olauncher-minimal-af-launcher?utm_source=github) page in the Olauncher settings for a complete list of features and FAQs.
